## Problem 1

```{r}
data("brfss_smart2010") 

brfss_cleaned = brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == 'Overall Health' & response %in% c('Excellent', 'Very good', 'Good', 'Fair', 'Poor')) %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, ordered = TRUE, levels = c('Excellent', 'Very good', 'Good', 'Fair', 'Poor'))) %>%
  rename(state = locationabbr,
         county = locationdesc)

str(brfss_cleaned)
```

```{r}
# Which states were observed at 7 locations in 2002?
brfss_cleaned %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%  # filter to only listings in 2002
  select(state, county) %>%  # select only state and county variables
  distinct() %>% # get distinct counties
  group_by(state) %>% # get distinct locations
  filter(n() == 7) %>%  # state listings that have exactly 7 counties listed
  distinct(state) # get states

brfss_cleaned %>%
  select(state, county, year) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  count(state, year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, color = state)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.6) + 
  labs(
    title = 'Number of counties that responded 2002-2010',
    y = 'Number of counties',
    x = 'Year', 
    fill = 'x'
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = 'right')
  # geom_smooth(method = 'loess', se = F, alpha = 0.5)
```
